Ceramics: art-based method of ceramics --> embodied practice in the researchThe sculptures become characters that can set the sceneFor example one part of the archive could talk about macro farming and Gascue√±a.

One character narrative talks about human point of view like the town community, association pueblos vivos,  social movements, politics, ... (megaphone) [working class history]

Other character put more energy to talk about non human (tardigarde)

Other about geological part and contamination (jellyfish) [blue humanities archive, oceanographies]

Other character maybe it's more meta and analyse the info to find bias and detect conflict or contradictions in the narratives (protest sign)
